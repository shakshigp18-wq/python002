Summary: This repository contains a set of small Python programs (Project) demonstrating list manipulation, data processing, and basic Python programming techniques. Each file is a standalone script that performs a specific task and can be run directly with Python.

project_01.py

Purpose: Demonstrates list creation and basic list operations by modeling a small book library.
Features: add books with append(), remove a book, check membership, count total books, sort alphabetically.

project_02.py

Purpose: Analyze an array of student test scores.
Features: finds highest/lowest scores, computes average, counts scores >80, lists scores above average, sorts and displays top 3, computes grade distribution (A–F).

project_03.py

Purpose: Manage a nested list acting as a category-based shopping cart.
Features: adds items per category, counts total items, finds category with most items, moves an item between categories, prints a receipt.

project_04.py

Purpose: Simulate playlist operations and basic text-based searching.
Features: shuffle playlist, show recently played tracks, remove duplicates, backup copy, merge playlists, build a simple "smart playlist" by keyword.

project_05.py

Purpose: Analyze daily temperature data for statistical and pattern insights.
Features: hottest/coldest day, average temperature, days above average, categorize temps (cold/mild/warm), detect longest hot streak, detect anomalies (>5°F change).

project_05.1.py

Purpose: A variant/extension of project_05.py with similar temperature analysis and additional outputs such as day indices for hottest/coldest and anomaly lists.
Features: same categories, longest streak detection, anomalies reported by day number, and a clear statistical summary printout.

Python Calculator with History

This is a simple command-line calculator built using Python that performs basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. What sets it apart is its built-in calculation history feature, which records each operation performed during the session. Users can view their past calculations at any time, making it a handy tool for quick math with a memory.

 Features:
 
- Interactive menu-driven interface
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Handles division by zero gracefully
- Maintains a session-based history of all calculations
- Option to view and review past operations
- 
 Ideal For:

- Beginners learning Python and control flow
- Practicing function creation and user input handling
- Building foundational command-line tools
